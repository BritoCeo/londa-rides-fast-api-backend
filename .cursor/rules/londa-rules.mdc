Version: 2.0
Date: 01 November 2024
Prepared by: Rachel Lazarus
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for Londa Rides CC, a ride-sharing app designed to provide

• Schedule rides to and from educational institutions and workplaces.
• Carpool with others traveling in similar directions.
• Purchase a fixed monthly package for parents, with an option to pay per ride.
This document details both functional and non-functional requirements, the system architecture, and expected performance
benchmarks.
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
• NAD - Namibian Dollar
• Londa Rides CC - The Londa ride-sharing platform
• Admin - Londa Rides administrators or system managers
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
Londa Rides CC is a mobile platform intended for users to find, schedule, and share rides. Users can choose to either book a single ride
or subscribe to a monthly package. The app will support Namibian routes with options for secure payment and user verification.
2.2 Product Functions
Londa Rides CC will allow:
• User Registration and Profile Management: Users (students, working professionals, and parents) can register, create

2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
• Students and Working Professionals: Primary users of the ride-sharing service.
• Parents: Users subscribing to a package for their children’s transportation.
• Drivers: Approved drivers providing rides, subject to vetting and background checks.
• Admins: Manage user data, payments, and system operations.
2.4 Operating Environment
Londa Rides CC will operate on:
• Mobile App: Android and iOS platforms.
2.5 Constraints
• Adherence to Namibia’s legal requirements for ridesharing.
• Compliance with data privacy and security standards.
• A budget constraint requiring cost-efficient solutions for app development and hosting.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 User Registration and Login
• Users register via email or social media.
• Password recovery and account settings management.
3.2 Ride Scheduling
• Users can input pickup and drop-off locations, select a date/time, and choose the number of passengers.
• Confirmation notifications for both drivers and passengers.
3.3 Driver payment
• Driver Subscription: Only the driver pays a monthly subscription fee of NAD 150.00 to access and offer rides through the
platform.
3.4 Parent and Rider Payments:
o Fixed Monthly Package for Parents: NAD 1000.00 per month for unlimited rides.
o Per-Ride Payment: NAD 13 per individual ride who pay to the driver.
• Secure payment gateway integration for handling driver subscriptions and any per-ride payments.
3.5 Ride Matching
• Algorithm matches users with drivers based on route and schedule compatibility.
• Notifications are sent to both driver and rider upon confirmation of a ride.
3.6 Admin Dashboard
• Admins can monitor rides, manage user data, and view payment histories.
• Reporting tools for tracking app usage, revenues, and subscription rates.
4. Non-functional Requirements
4.1 Performance Requirements
• Average response time should not exceed 2 minutes.
• System should handle at least 10,000 concurrent users.
4.2 Reliability
• System uptime of 99.5%.
• Automated backups to prevent data loss.
4.3 Security
• User data encryption both at rest and in transit.
• Compliance with data protection standards (e.g., GDPR equivalent if applicable in Namibia).
4.4 Usability
• User-friendly interfaces for easy navigation and booking.
• Accessible design for users with disabilities.
5. External Interface Requirements
5.1 User Interface (UI)
• Simple registration and ride-booking screens.
• Subscription management interface for parent packages.
5.2 Hardware Interface

• Privacy compliance as per Namibian data protection laws.
6.2 Future Enhancements
• User ratings and reviews for drivers.
• Expansion to include intercity rides.
This document provides a foundational overview. For further specifications, including detailed wireframes and API documentation, it
would be necessary to develop a detailed technical design document.
