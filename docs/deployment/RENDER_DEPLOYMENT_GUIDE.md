# Render Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the Londa Rides backend microservices to Render.

## Prerequisites

1. **Render Account**: Sign up at [render.com](https://render.com)
2. **GitHub Repository**: Your code should be in [https://github.com/BritoCeo/londa-rides-backend](https://github.com/BritoCeo/londa-rides-backend)
3. **Firebase Service Account Key**: JSON file for Firestore access
4. **Environment Variables**: Prepare all required environment variables

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Using Blueprint with render.yaml (Recommended) - ONE DEPLOYMENT FOR ALL SERVICES

**Important**: When you use the Blueprint with `render.yaml`, you perform **ONE single deployment action** that creates and deploys **ALL services simultaneously**. You don't need to deploy each service separately.

The repository includes a `render.yaml` file that automatically configures all 6 services in one go.

#### How It Works:

1. **Single Blueprint Deployment**:
   - You connect your repository **once**
   - Render reads `render.yaml` and creates **all 6 services** automatically
   - You click "Apply" **once**
   - Render builds and deploys **all services** in parallel

2. **What Gets Created**:
   - Render creates 6 separate web services (one for each microservice):
     - `shared-build` (build helper)
     - `api-gateway` (main entry point)
     - `auth-service` (authentication)
     - `user-service` (user management)
     - `driver-service` (driver management)
     - `ride-service` (ride management)

3. **Why Multiple Services?**:
   - This is the **correct microservices architecture**
   - Each service runs independently
   - Each service can scale separately
   - Each service can be updated independently
   - But you deploy them all **in one action** using the Blueprint

#### Steps:

1. **Connect Repository to Render** (ONE TIME):
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
   - Select "Public Git Repository" tab
   - Enter repository URL: `https://github.com/BritoCeo/londa-rides-backend`
   - Click "Connect"
   - Render will automatically detect `render.yaml` and show all 6 services

2. **Review Services** (All shown at once):
   - Render will display all services from `render.yaml`:
     - shared-build
     - api-gateway
     - auth-service
     - user-service
     - driver-service
     - ride-service

3. **Configure Environment Variables** (Before deploying):
   - You can set environment variables for each service before clicking "Apply"
   - **Auth Service**: Set `JWT_SECRET` (required)
   - **User/Driver/Ride Services**: Set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (JSON content) and `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - Service URLs for API Gateway are automatically set by Render using `fromService` references

4. **Deploy Everything** (ONE CLICK):
   - Click "Apply" at the bottom **once**
   - Render will build and deploy **all 6 services automatically** in parallel
   - Monitor the build logs for each service (they all build simultaneously)
   - Wait for all services to finish deploying

**Result**: After this single deployment action, you'll have all 6 services running on Render, each with its own URL and independent lifecycle.

### Option 2: Manual Web Service Creation

If you prefer to create services manually (one at a time):

#### For API Gateway:

1. **Create Web Service**:
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Select "Public Git Repository" tab
   - Enter: `https://github.com/BritoCeo/londa-rides-backend`
   - Click "Connect"

2. **Configure Service**:
   - **Name**: `api-gateway`
   - **Region**: `Oregon` (or your preferred)
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Root Directory**: (leave empty)
   - **Runtime**: `Node`
   - **Build Command**:
     ```bash
     npm install
     cd shared && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
     cd services/api-gateway && npm install && npm run build
     ```
   - **Start Command**:
     ```bash
     cd services/api-gateway && npm run start:uat
     ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - `NODE_ENV` = `uat`
   - `PORT` = `8000`
   - `LOG_LEVEL` = `info`
   - `USER_SERVICE_URL` = (set after user-service is deployed)
   - `DRIVER_SERVICE_URL` = (set after driver-service is deployed)
   - `AUTH_SERVICE_URL` = (set after auth-service is deployed)
   - `RIDE_SERVICE_URL` = (set after ride-service is deployed)

4. **Click "Create Web Service"**

5. **Repeat for other services** (auth-service, user-service, driver-service, ride-service) with their respective configurations from `render.yaml`

## Environment Variables

### API Gateway

| Variable | Value | Required |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `uat` | Yes |

## Setting Firebase Service Account Key

**Important**: The current code expects `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` to be a **file path**. For Render deployment, you have two options:

### Option 1: Store JSON Content as Environment Variable (Recommended)

You'll need to modify the Firebase initialization code to accept JSON content directly. Update `services/*/src/server.ts` to handle JSON string:

```typescript
if (process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY) {
  try {
    // Try parsing as JSON string first (for Render)
    let serviceAccount;
    try {
      serviceAccount = JSON.parse(process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY);
    } catch {
      // Fallback to file path (for local development)
      const serviceAccountPath = path.resolve(process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY);
      serviceAccount = require(serviceAccountPath);
    }
    initializeApp({
      credential: cert(serviceAccount),
      projectId: process.env.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID || 'londa-cd054',
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

Then in Render, set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` to the **entire JSON content as a string**.

### Option 2: Use File Path (Alternative)

If you prefer to keep the file path approach, you can:
1. Store the service account key file in your repository (not recommended for security)
2. Or use Render's file system to store it

**For now, the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` environment variable should contain the **entire JSON content** of your Firebase service account key file as a string.**

### Option 1: JSON String (Recommended)

1. Open your `service-account-key.json` file
2. Copy the entire JSON content
3. Paste it as the value for `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` in Render

**Note**: Make sure to escape quotes if needed, or use Render's "Secret File" option.

### Option 2: Base64 Encoded

Alternatively, you can base64 encode the file:

```bash
# On Mac/Linux
base64 -i service-account-key.json

# On Windows (PowerShell)
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("service-account-key.json"))
```

Then decode it in your application code.

### Option 3: Environment Variable File Path

If your service account key is stored as a file path, you'll need to modify the code to read from an environment variable that contains the file path or JSON content directly.

## Service URLs

After deployment, Render will provide URLs for each service:

- **API Gateway**: `https://api-gateway-xxxx.onrender.com` (Public URL - use this for all API requests)
- **Auth Service**: `https://auth-service-xxxx.onrender.com` (Internal)
- **User Service**: `https://user-service-xxxx.onrender.com` (Internal)
- **Driver Service**: `https://driver-service-xxxx.onrender.com` (Internal)
- **Ride Service**: `https://ride-service-xxxx.onrender.com` (Internal)

**Important**: Only the API Gateway URL should be used externally. Other services are internal and should not be accessed directly.

## Build Process

The build process for each service:

1. Install root dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build shared package: `cd shared && npm install && npm run build`
3. Build service: `cd services/[service-name] && npm install && npm run build`

## Health Checks

Each service has a health check endpoint at `/health`:

- API Gateway: `https://api-gateway-xxxx.onrender.com/health`
- Auth Service: `https://auth-service-xxxx.onrender.com/health`
- User Service: `https://user-service-xxxx.onrender.com/health`
- Driver Service: `https://driver-service-xxxx.onrender.com/health`
- Ride Service: `https://ride-service-xxxx.onrender.com/health`

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

1. **"Cannot find module '@londa-rides/shared'"**:
   - Ensure shared package is built before service builds
   - Check that build commands are in correct order

2. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**:
   - Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed

3. **Firebase Initialization Errors**:
   - Verify `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` is set correctly
   - Check `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` matches your Firebase project
   - Ensure service account has proper permissions

### Runtime Errors

1. **Service Connection Errors**:
   - Verify service URLs are correctly set in API Gateway
   - Check that all services are deployed and running
   - Review service logs in Render dashboard

2. **Port Conflicts**:
   - Render automatically assigns ports, but ensure `PORT` env var matches
   - Check that services are using the correct ports

3. **Environment Variable Issues**:
   - Verify all required environment variables are set
   - Check for typos in variable names
   - Ensure sensitive values (JWT_SECRET) are set

## Custom Domain Setup

To use a custom domain for the API Gateway:

1. Go to API Gateway service in Render dashboard
2. Click "Settings" → "Custom Domains"
3. Add your domain (e.g., `api.londarides.com`)
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions

## Monitoring

Render provides:

- **Logs**: Real-time logs for each service
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, and request metrics
- **Alerts**: Set up alerts for service failures

## Cost Considerations

**Important**: With the free tier, you can deploy all services for free, but:
- Services will sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- Each service is independent (6 services = 6 free tier instances)

**Pricing**:
- **Free Tier**: $0/month (6 services = $0/month) - Services sleep after inactivity
- **Starter Plan**: $7/month per service (6 services = $42/month) - Always-on services
- **Recommendation**: Start with free tier for UAT, upgrade to starter for production

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit** `.env.prd` files or service account keys
2. **Use Render Secrets** for sensitive environment variables
3. **Enable HTTPS** (automatic on Render)
4. **Set strong JWT secrets** in production
5. **Regularly rotate** secrets and API keys

## Updating Services

To update services after code changes:

1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Render will automatically detect changes (if auto-deploy is enabled)
3. Or manually trigger deployment from Render dashboard

## Support

For issues:
1. Check Render service logs
2. Review build logs for errors
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Check service health endpoints
